# Previous versions of this script don't work because they hadn't been updated since 2012. There are now more steps involved to set this up.

# This script update is based on information found here: https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/domains-domain-id-records-record-id/#put

# You first must find out the domain ID and resource ID numbers. In order to do this follow the steps below.
# 1. Create a Linode API Key through your account profile at https://cloud.linode.com/dashboard. Give it rights to read/write to domains only.
# 2. From a shell run the following command: LINODE_API_KEY=[insert API key from step 1 here]
# 3. Run the following command to get the domain ID number for the domain you want to manage: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LINODE_API_KEY" https://api.linode.com/v4/domains/
# 4. From a shell run the following command: DOMAIN_ID=[insert domain ID number from step 3 here]
# 5. Run the following command to get the resource ID number for the subdomain you want to manage: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LINODE_API_KEY" https://api.linode.com/v4/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/records/
# 6. From a shell run the following command: RESOURCE_ID=[insert resource ID number from step 5 here]
# 7. Run the following command to verify the current settings for this resource: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LINODE_API_KEY" https://api.linode.com/v4/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/records/$RESOURCE_ID
# 8. Use the information collected from these commands to complete the variables below in this script.
